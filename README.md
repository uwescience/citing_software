## How to cite software?

What is the best way to cite software in publications, and how should
software projects recommend being cited?

This page contains some links for an informal discussion at the 
[PDESoft 2014 workshop](http://www.pdesoft.uni-hd.de/)

### General Guides

* [Software Sustainability Institute](http://software.ac.uk/so-exactly-what-software-did-you-use) 
     ... [other useful software guides](http://www.software.ac.uk/resources/guides-everything) 
*  [Alternative Impact Manifesto](http://software.ac.uk/blog/2011-05-02-publish-or-be-damned-alternative-impact-manifesto-research-software) 


### Some Examples -- PDEs and related software

### Some Examples -- other software

*  [IPython](http://ipython.org/citing.html) 
*  [R language](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15688758/r-stats-citation-for-a-scientific-paper) 
*  [Sage](http://wiki.sagemath.org/Publications_using_SAGE) 


### Generating DOIs for software releases (with Github integration)

*  [zenodo] (https://zenodo.org/) 
*  [figshare] (http://mozillascience.github.io/code-research-object/) 


### Venues for publishing software papers

*  [Geoscientific Model Development (GMD)](http://www.geoscientific-model-development.net/home.html) has been used to publish short papers with
current authors for each new release of software project.
*  [Stackexchange discussion](http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/660/venues-for-publishing-papers-that-emphasize-software)  with many more links

* See http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.2266 for an example of a short paper
  associated with each specific release.  (But note that arXiv insisted 
  that the papers announcing 8.0 and 8.1 were two versions of the same paper,
  rather than two distinct papers as was desired.)
